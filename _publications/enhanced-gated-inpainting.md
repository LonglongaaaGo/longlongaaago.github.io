<b>Abstract:</b>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Image inpainting is widely used to fill the damaged or masked area in an image with
realistic visual contents. However, most existing inpainting methods have limitations
in reconstructing global structures for large-scale damaged areas. This paper proposes
a novel high-quality generative image inpainting method by decomposing the generative
network into three modules. First, an enhanced gated convolution is introduced to
extract shallow features by making full use of the input mask and the gating mechanism.
Second, a U-net-like deep semantic structure modeling module is presented by
leveraging the Transformers’ strong ability of long-distance modeling and CNNs’ rich
texture patterns learning abilities. Finally, a reconstruction module is employed to generate
the inpainted result by combining shallow textural features and deep structural
features. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed image
inpainting method is able to produce high-quality visual eects and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in many quantitative metrics. </div>
