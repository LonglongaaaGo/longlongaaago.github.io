<b> Brief description:</b>
Facial image inpainting is a task of filling plausible and semantically meaningful contents for missing pixels in a face image. This paper presents a novel EXEmplar-guided  diverse facial image inpainting  framework, EXE-GAN, which can perform high-quality inpainting with clear manifestations of exemplar attributes. Experimental results and comparisons on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets are shown to demonstrate that the effectiveness of proposed components, and our method can perform diverse exemplar-based facial attributes image inpainting with high fidelity.
